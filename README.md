# Illustratum Project 2022

## TODOs

#### Demos
- [ ] Gravitational field visualisation
- [ ] Barycentre demo

#### Smaller stuff
- [x] Show the distance scale (and possibly time scale)
- [x] Show next section only after succeeding in first section
- [x] Explanation for Kepler's laws
- [x] Increase margin of error for Apoapsis & Periapsis
- [x] Show failure for circular orbit view
- [x] Actually use deltaTime in calculations
- [x] Fix positioning of forces vector label
- [x] Anti-aliasing of graphics

#### Bugs
- [x] Fix inconsistent angle direction
- [x] CircularOrbitScene - changing the angle while magnitude is 0.
- [x] Reset the position of the sun as well 
- [x] CircularOrbitScene - spamming reset causes duplicate distance indicator
- [ ] CircularOrbitScene - Weird values get accepted (on high fps screens ?!?)
