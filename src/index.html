        <a href="assets/patches.jpg">Patches</a> is a cat living on a blue
        planet orbiting a red star. She has always wondered how her planet
        orbits her star. To answer that, we need to understand gravity itself.
        In Newtonian mechanics, gravity can be described using
        <strong>Newtonâ€™s law of universal gravitation</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Try dragging around the two bodies below and try to figure out how the
        distance between objects is related to the force due to gravity. Is it
        linearly proportional? Or is it inversely proportional? Or some other
        relationship?
      </p>

      <p>
        These types of relationships can be expressed as $F \propto r^\alpha$,
        where $r$ is the distance between the two objects, $F$ is the force
        due to gravity, and $\alpha$ describes the actual relationship. For
        example, if they are linearly proportional, $\alpha$ would be 1, while
        $\alpha = -1$ if it was inversely proportional.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hint: you can move the objects different distances and plot a graph of
        force against distance, and look at the shape of the graph.
      </p>

      <aside class="warn">
        Do note that the lengths of the arrows are not linearly related to the
        magnitude of the forces, so try to look at the numbers instead of the
        length of the arrows. The arrows are drawn this way to try and avoid
        overcrowding the scene while accommodating a wide range of magnitudes.

    Throughout all the demos, the blue body will have a mass $5.97 \times
    10^{24} \ \text{kg}$ (which is the mass of the Earth), and the red body
    will have a mass of $1.99 \times 10^{30} \ \text{kg}$ (which is the mass
    of the Sun).
  </aside>

  <div class="explanation-section-container">
    <div class="explanation-section">
      <p>
        That's right, the relationship between $F$ and $r$ is
        <em>inverse square</em>. When the distance increases twofold, the
        force decreases four fold!
      </p>

      <p>
        The actual law states that $$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$ where $m_1$ and
        $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects. $G$ is the gravitational
        constant (you can think of it a proportionality constant), $G = 6.67
        \times 10^{-11} \ \text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2\cdot\text{kg}^{-2}$.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patches notices that this equation does not take into account which
        objects the force of attraction is acting on, and that is because the
        force acts with equal magnitude on both objects, regardless of mass.
        The earth experiences the same force of attraction towards the sun as
        the sun towards the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that can't be right, you say. Why does the Earth even orbit the
        Sun if they are both being pulled on with the same force? Well, it is
        because the sun is much more massive, so it is accelerated less by the
        same force of attraction, as seen from Newton's second law $\Sigma F =
        ma$.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        We can also express the effect one massive body has on another with
        something know as a gravitational field. The gravitational field is a
        vector field, which means it associates each point in space with a
        vector. It is defined as $$\vec{g} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m}$$ where $m$ is
        the mass of a <em>test particle</em>. Note that the gravitational
        field has the same units as acceleration, $\text{m} \cdot
        \text{s}^{-2}$.
      </p>

      <aside class="warn">
        The gravitational field does NOT depend on the mass of the test
        charge. Hopefully you'll see why in a moment.
      </aside>

      <p>
        Another way of looking at this is that the gravitational field at a
        particular point gives the
        <em>acceleration</em> of a body at that point (provided, of course,
        that the gravitational force is the only force acting on the body).
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us look at the gravitational field of a single body with mass $M$.
        Because of symmetry, the gravitational field must be radial, i.e.
        always pointing directly away/towards the body. To we can use Newton's
        law of universal gravitation to calculate this field: $$
        \begin{align*} \vec{F}(r) &= G \frac{Mm}{r^2} \hat{r} \\
        \Longrightarrow \vec{g}(r) &= \frac{\vec{F}}{m} = G
        \frac{M}{r^2}\hat{r} \end{align*}$$ where $\vec{r}$ is the vector
        pointing from the test particle to our body $M$, and $r$ is the
        magnitude of $\vec{r}$.
      </p>

      <aside class="info">
        Remember, the gravitational field is a <em>vector</em> field, so it
        must have a direction. In this case, $\hat{r}$ refers to the unit
        vector in the direction of $\vec{r}$, which is the mathematical way of
        saying our field is radial.
      </aside>

      <p>
        The gravitational field can be visualised by drawing a vector field.
        We sample points in space, then draw a arrow there to represent the
        gravitational field at that point. The length of the arrows are NOT
        drawn to scale in order to avoid overlaps, so the colour of the vector
        will be used to represent the magnitude of the vector instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following is a visualisation of the gravitational field caused by
        Patches' red star. Try dragging around the bodies, you'll notice that
        the force on the blue planet is in the same direction as the field, as
        can be deduced from the definition.
      </p>

      <aside class="info">
        In this case, you can think of the blue planet as a test particle.
      </aside>

      <div id="gravitational-field" class="canvas-container"></div>

      <p>
        The gravitational field obeys the <em>superposition</em> principle,
        which says that the gravitational field caused by multiple bodies is
        the vector sum of the gravitational field caused by each body
        individually.
      </p>

      <p>
        This can be seen in the next visualisation, where the gravitational
        field caused by two red stars is shown.

      <p>
        Now, back to Patches' blue planet. Patches aspires to be the first cat
        to go to space. To do that, she needs to get into orbit around the
        planet. An orbit is when you are travelling fast enough around a
        planet to not crash into the planet. You are always falling towards
        your planet, and gravity acts on you like normal, however, you are
        moving fast enough that you never actually crash into the planet.
      </p>

      <p>
        But how fast is fast enough? And in what direction should your
        velocity be?
      </p>

      <aside class="warn">
        Remember, velocity is a <em>vector</em>, which means that it has both
        a magnitude and a direction.
      </aside>

      <p>
        Let's look at the simplest case: a circular orbit. Try to get the blue
        planet an initial velocity such that it goes into circular orbit (it
        doesn't have to be perfect, we'll accept some margin of error ðŸ™‚).
      </p>

      <p>
        To set the initial velocity, you can either type in the boxes at the
        bottom right, or click anywhere to point the velocity vector that way.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're feeling up for it, the exact velocity and direction can be
        calculated. we'll show the derivation afterwards, but you're welcome
        to try yourself :p
      </p>

      <aside class="info">
        If you play around with the demo below, you may realise that
        sometimes, orbit of the blue planet is actually changing, for example
        with an initial velocity of 1.6e4 m/s pointing upwards, the orbit of
        the planet appears to be "drifting". Do note that
        <strong>that does not happen in real life</strong>, and is a
        consequence of the integration method used in the simulations. These
        simulations are only approximations of what happens in real life.
        Usually, the approximations are very accurate, but it breaks down when
        large forces and velocities are involved. If you're curious, see the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler method</a>

        Great! You made it! This is one example of
        <em>uniform circular motion</em>. Uniform circular motion is when a
        body moves in a circle with a constant magnitude of velocity. Do note
        that even though the <em>magnitude</em> of velocity remains constant,
        the <em>direction</em> of velocity is always changing, so it has to be
        accelerating.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, this acceleration never changes the direction of the
        velocity, it has to point perpendicular to the velocity.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, the acceleration is provided by the force the red body
        exerts on the blue one and is <em>radial</em> (points towards the
        centre of the circle), so for there to be uniform circular motion,
        <strong>the velocity must be tangential to the circle of motion</strong>, aka the angle is either 0 or 180
        degrees pointing vertically up or
        down (in this situation with the blue planet starting directly to the
        right of the red one). You should have reached this same conclusion
        from the eariler demo.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ok, we know the <em>direction</em> of the velocity, but what about the
        <em>magnitude</em> of the velocity? Here is where the math comes in.
        Uniform circular motion is described by the equation $$a =
        \frac{v^2}{r}$$ From a previous demo, we know that the force of
        gravitational attraction is $$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$ if we let
        $m_1$ be the mass of the blue planet and $m_2$ be the mass of the red
        planet. Applying Newton's second law, $$\begin{align*}F &= m_1 a \\
        \Longrightarrow v &= \sqrt{\frac{G m_2}{r}}\end{align*}$$ Substituting
        in the masses of the red star and the distances, we get a value of
        around $3.0 \times 10^4 \ \text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$.
      </p>

      <aside class="info">
        You may have realised that the red planet is not moving at all, even
        though there is a net force acting on it. Is it violating Newton's
        second law?

        <p>
          No, although it doesn't <em>look like</em> its moving, it still is,
          just that its so small you can't see it. Because its so massive, we
          can safely assume that it stays fixed in place. This was explained
          in the last few paragraphs of the previous section.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <hr />

      <p>
        Actually, circular orbits are not the only types of trajectory that
        can exist in a two body system. If you played around with the previous
        demo, you might've realised that apart from circular trajectories,
        there are many other possible trajectories, for example what looks
        like an ellipse. And indeed, it can be proved that
        <strong>the trajectories of a body in a two body system is a conic
          section</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, what exactly is a conic section? It is simply a curve that can be
        obtained by the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane, as
        visualised by the figure below.
      </p>

        In the figure, #1 is a circle, as we've already seen from the previous
        demo. #2 is an <em>ellipse</em>, #3 is a <em>parabola</em>, and #4 is
        a <em>hyperbola</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next few demos explores the different properties of an elliptical
        orbit. First, let's us look at two terms: the
        <strong>apoapsis point </strong>and the
        <strong>periapsis point</strong>. They are points on the blue planet's
        elliptical orbit. Try to deduce where these two points are in the next
        two demos.
      </p>

      <div id="apoapsis" class="canvas-container"></div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="explanation-section-container">
    <div class="explanation-section">
      <p>
        As you might have deduced, the apoapsis point is the point on the
        orbit where the blue planet is the farthest away from the red one. Can
        you take an educated guess as to where the periapsis point is now?
      </p>

      <div id="periapsis" class="canvas-container"></div>

  <div class="explanation-section-container">
    <div class="explanation-section">
      <p>
        That's right, the periapsis point is just the point in the orbit where
        the two bodies are the closest.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        Now, Patches is a very educated cat, and she notices that the red star
        looks like its at one of the foci (plural of "focus") of the ellipse
        that is the blue planet's orbit.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        And indeed, the red star <em>is</em> at the focus of the elliptical
        orbit. Patches has just stumbled across one of
        <strong>Kepler's laws of planetary motion</strong>, descrbing orbits
        of planets around the Sun. The first law states that
        <em>the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two
          foci</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second law says that a line segment joining a planet and the Sun
        sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. This means that
        the speed of the planet is faster when it is closer to the Sun, and
        slower when it is farther away.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third and last law says that the square of a planet's orbital
        period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major
        axis of its orbit.
      </p>

      <aside class="info">
        Do note that Kepler's laws of planetary motion can be derived from
        Newton's law of universal gravitation, although the derivations are
        quite complicated, so we will not talk about it.
      </aside>

      <hr />

      <p>
        Well, that's enough physics for Patches today. There is still so much
        more to orbital mechanics than what is mentioned here, but
        unfortunately Illustratum judging day is coming up and we don't have
        time to code the demos, so (for now), Patches' space journey ends
        here. Byeee!
