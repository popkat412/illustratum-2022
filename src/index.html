        <p>
          <a href="assets/patches.jpg">Patches</a> is a cat living on a blue
          planet orbiting a red star. She has always wondered how her planet
          orbits her star. To answer that, we need to understand gravity itself.
          In Newtonian mechanics, gravity can be described using
          <strong>Newtonâ€™s law of universal gravitation</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Try dragging around the two bodies below and try to figure out how the
          distance between objects is reltaed to the force due to gravity. Is it
          linearly proportional? Or is it inversely proportional? Or some other
          relationship?
        </p>

        <aside class="info">
          Throught all the demos, the blue body will have a mass $5.97 \times
          10^{24} \ \text{kg}$ (which is the mass of the Earth), and the red
          body will have a mass of $1.99 \times 10^{30} \ \text{kg}$ (which is
          the mass of the Sun).
        </aside>

        <p>
          These types of relationships can be expressed as $F \propto r^\alpha$,
          where $r$ is the distance between the two objects, $F$ is the force
          due to gravity, and $\alpha$ describes the actual relationship. For
          example, if they are linearly proportional, $\alpha$ would be 1, while
          $\alpha = -1$ if it was inversely proportional.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hint: you can move the objects different distances and plot a graph of
          force against distance, and look at the shape of the graph.
        </p>

        <aside class="warn">
          Do note that the lengths of the arrows are not linearly related to the
          magnitude of the forces, so try to look at the numbers instead of the
          length of the arrows. The arrows are drawn this way to try and avoid
          overcrowding the scene while accomodating a wide range of magnitudes.

        <p>
          That's right, the relationship between $F$ and $r$ is
          <em>inverse square</em>. When the distance increases twofold, the
          force decreases four fold!
        </p>

        <p>
          The actual law states that $$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$ where $m_1$ and
          $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects. $G$ is the gravitational
          constant (you can think of it a proportionality constant), $G = 6.67
          \times 10^{-11} \ \text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2\cdot\text{kg}^{-2}$.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may notice that this equation does not take into account which
          objects the force of attraction is acting on, and that is because the
          force acts with equal magnitude on both objects, regardless of mass.
          The earth experiences the same force of attraction towards the sun as
          the sun towards the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, why does the earth orbit the sun if they are both being pulled
          on with the same force? That is because the sun is much more massive,
          so it is accelerated less by the same force of attraction.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <p>
          Now, back to planet XYZ. Coincidentally, planet XYZ also has a mass of
          $5.97 \times 10^{24} \ \text{kg}$. To explore the vastness of space,
          you first have to start orbiting your planet, but what exactly is an
          orbit? An orbit is when you are travelling fast enough around a planet
          to not crash into the planet. You are always falling towards your
          planet, and gravity acts on you like normal, however, you are moving
          fast enough that you never actually crash into the planet.
        </p>

        <p>
          But how fast is fast enough? And in what direction should the velocity
          be?
        </p>

        <aside class="warn">
          Remember, velcoity is a <em>vector</em>, which means that it has both
          a magnitude and a direction.
        </aside>

        <p>
          Let's look at the simplest case: a circular orbit. Try to get the blue
          planet an initial velocity such that it goes into circular orbit (it
          doesn't have to be perfect, we'll accept some margin of error ðŸ™‚).
        </p>

        <p>
          To set the intial velocity, you can either type in the boxes at the
          bottom right, or click anywhere to point the velocity vector that way.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're feeling up for it, the exact velocity and direction can be
          calculated. we'll show the derivation afterwards, but you're welcome
          to try youself :p
        </p>

        <aside class="info">
          If you play around with the demo below, you may realise that
          sometimes, orbit of the blue planet is actually changing, for example
          with an initial velocity of 1.6e4 m/s pointing upwards, the orbit of
          the planet appears to be "drifting". Do note that
          <strong>that does not happen in real life</strong>, and is a
          consequence of the integration method used in the simulations. These
          simulations are only approximations of what happens in real life.
          Usually, the approximations are very accurate, but it breaks down when
          large forces and velocities are involved. If you're curious, see the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler method</a>

          Great! You made it! This is one example of
          <em>uniform circular motion</em>. Uniform circular motion is when a
          body moves in a circle with a constant magnitude of velocity. Do note
          that even though the <em>magnitude</em> of velocity remains constant,
          the <em>direction</em> of velocity is always changing, so it has to be
          accelerating.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, this acceleration never changes the direction of the
          velocity, it has to point perpendicular to the velocity.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this case, the acceleration is provided by the force the red body
          exerts on the blue one and is <em>radial</em> (points towards the
          centre of the circle), so for there to be uniform circular motion,
          <strong
            >the velocity must be tangential to the circle of motion</strong
          >, aka the angle is either 0 or 180 degrees pointing vertically up or
          down (in this situation with the blue planet starting directly to the
          right of the red one). You should have reached this same conclusion
          from the eariler demo.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ok, we know the <em>direction</em> of the velocity, but what about the
          <em>magnitude</em> of the velocity? Here is where the math comes in.
          Uniform circular motion is described by the equation $$a =
          \frac{v^2}{r}$$ From a previous demo, we know that the force of
          gravitational attraction is $$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$ if we let
          $m_1$ be the mass of the blue planet and $m_2$ be the mass of the red
          planet. Applying Newton's second law, $$\begin{align*}F &= m_1 a \\
          \Longrightarrow v &= \sqrt{\frac{G m_2}{r}}\end{align*}$$ Substituting
          in the masses of the red star and the distances, we get a value of
          around $3.0 \times 10^4 \ \text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$.
        </p>

        <aside class="info">
          You may have realised that the red planet is not moving at all, even
          though there is a net force acting on it. Is it violating Newton's
          second law?

          <p>
            No, although it doesn't <em>look like</em> its moving, it still is,
            just that because its so massive, we can safely assume that it stays
            fixed in place. This was explained in the last few paragraphs of the
            previous section.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <hr />

        <p>
          Actually, circular orbits are not the only types of trajectory that
          can exist in a two body system. If you played around with the previous
          demo, you might've realised that apart from circular trajectories,
          there are many other possible trajectories, for example what looks
          like an ellipse. And indeed, it can be proved that
          <strong
            >the trajectories of a body in a two body system is a conic
            section</strong
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, what exactly is a conic section? It is simply a curve that can be
          obtained by the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane, as
          visualised by the figure below.
        </p>

          In the figure, #1 is a circle, as we've already seen from the previous
          demo. #2 is an <em>ellipse</em>, #3 is a <em>parabola</em>, and #4 is
          a <em>hyperbola</em>.

        <p>
          The next few demos explores the different properties of an elliptical
          orbit. First, let's us look at two terms: the
          <strong>apoapsis point </strong>and the
          <strong>periapsis point</strong>. They are points on the blue planet's
          elliptical orbit. Try to deduce where these two points are in the next
          two demos.

    <div class="explanation-section-container">
      <div class="explanation-section">
        <p>
          As you might have deduced, the apoapsis point is the point on the
          orbit where the blue planet is the farthest away from the red one. Can
          you take an educated guess as to where the periapsis point is now?

          That's right, the periapsis point is just the point in the orbit where
          the two bodies are the closest.

        <hr />

        <p>
          Now, Patches is a very educated cat, and she notices that the red star
          looks like its at one of the foci (plural of "focus") of the ellipse
          that is the blue planet's orbit.

          And indeed, the red star <em>is</em> at the focus of the elliptical
          orbit. Patches has just stumbled across one of
          <strong>Kepler's laws of planetary motion</strong>. The first law
          states that
          <em
            >the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two
