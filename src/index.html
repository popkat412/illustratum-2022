      You are an alien on planet XYZ, and you want to explore your planet’s
      moon, ABC. But how do you get there? To do that, we need to escape the
      clutches of planet XYZ’s gravitational field. But first, we need to
      understand gravity itself. In Newtonian mechanics, gravity can be
      described using <strong>Newton’s law of universal gravitation</strong> It
      states that $F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$ is the <em>magnitude</em> of the
      force of attraction between two objects with mass, where $m_1$ and $m_2$
      are the masses of the two objects and $r$ is the radius between them. $G$
      is the gravitational constant, $6.67 \times 10^{-11} \ \
      \text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2\cdot\text{kg}^{-2}$. You may notice that this
      equation does not take into account which objects the force of attraction
      is acting on, and that is because the force acts with equal magnitude on
      both objects, regardless of mass. The earth experiences the same force of
      attraction towards the sun as the sun towards the earth. Then, why does
      the earth orbit the sun if they are both being pulled on with the same
      force? That is because the sun is much more <strong>massive</strong>, so
      it is accelerated less by the same force of attraction.

      Now, back to planet XYZ. Coincidentally, planet XYZ also has a mass of
      $5.97 \times 10^{24} \ \text{kg}$. To explore the vastness of space, you
      first have to start orbiting your planet, but what exactly is an orbit? An
      orbit is when you are travelling fast enough around a planet to not crash
      into the planet. You are always falling towards your planet, and gravity
      acts on you like normal, however, you are moving fast enough that you
      never actually crash into the planet. The speed required for such an orbit
      is given by $v = \sqrt{GM/R}$, where $v$ is the speed required for the
      orbit, $G$ is the universal gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the
      planet, and $R$ is the radius of the circular orbit.
