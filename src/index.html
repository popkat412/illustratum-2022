      You are an alien on planet XYZ, and you want to explore your planetâ€™s
      moon, ABC. But how do you get there? To do that, we need to escape the
      clutches of planet XYZâ€™s gravitational field. But first, we need to
      understand gravity itself. In Newtonian mechanics, gravity can be
      described using <strong>Newtonâ€™s law of universal gravitation</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Try dragging around the two bodies below and try to figure out how the
      distance between objects is reltaed to the force due to gravity. Is it
      linearly proportional? Or is it inversely proportional? Or some other
      relationship?
    </p>

    <aside class="info">
      Throught all the demos, the blue body will have a mass $5.97 \times
      10^{24}$ (which is the mass of the Earth), and the red body will have a
      mass of $1.99 \times 10^{30}$ (which is the mass of the Sun).
    </aside>

    <p>
      These types of relationships can be expressed as $F \propto r^\alpha$,
      where $r$ is the distance between the two objects, $F$ is the force due to
      gravity, and $\alpha$ describes the actual relationship. For example, if
      they are linearly proportional, $\alpha$ would be 1, while $\alpha = -1$
      if it was inversely proportional.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hint: you can move the objects different distances and plot a graph of
      force against distance, and look at the shape of the graph.
    </p>

    <aside class="warn">
      Do note that the lengths of the arrows are not linearly related to the
      magnitude of the forces, so try to look at the numbers instead of the
      length of the arrows. The arrows are drawn this way to try and avoid
      overcrowding the scene while accomodating a wide range of magnitudes.
    </aside>

    <div class="canvas-container" id="forces">
      <div class="bottom-right-ui">
        <div>
          <label for="answer">$\alpha = \ $</label>
          <input
            autocomplete="off"
            type="number"
            id="forces-answer-box"
            name="answer"
          />

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      That's right, the relationship between $F$ and $r$ is
      <em>inverse square</em>. When the distance increases twofold, the force
      decreases four fold!
    </p>

    <p>
      The actual law states that $$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$ where $m_1$ and
      $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects. $G$ is the gravitational constant
      (you can think of it a proportionality constant), $G = 6.67 \times
      10^{-11} \ \text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2\cdot\text{kg}^{-2}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may notice that this equation does not take into account which objects
      the force of attraction is acting on, and that is because the force acts
      with equal magnitude on both objects, regardless of mass. The earth
      experiences the same force of attraction towards the sun as the sun
      towards the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, why does the earth orbit the sun if they are both being pulled on
      with the same force? That is because the sun is much more massive, so it
      is accelerated less by the same force of attraction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, back to planet XYZ. Coincidentally, planet XYZ also has a mass of
      $5.97 \times 10^{24} \ \text{kg}$. To explore the vastness of space, you
      first have to start orbiting your planet, but what exactly is an orbit? An
      orbit is when you are travelling fast enough around a planet to not crash
      into the planet. You are always falling towards your planet, and gravity
      acts on you like normal, however, you are moving fast enough that you
      never actually crash into the planet.
    </p>

    <p>
      But how fast is fast enough? And in what direction should the velocity be?
    </p>

    <aside class="warn">
      Remember, velcoity is a <em>vector</em>, which means that it has both a
      magnitude and a direction.
    </aside>

    <p>
      Let's look at the simplest case: a circular orbit. Try to get the blue
      planet an initial velocity such that it goes into circular orbit (it
      doesn't have to be perfect, we'll accept some margin of error ðŸ™‚).
    </p>

    <p>
      To set the intial velocity, you can either type in the boxes at the bottom
      right, or click anywhere to point the velocity vector that way.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're feeling up for it, the exact velocity and direction can be
      calculated. we'll show the derivation afterwards, but you're welcome to
      try youself :p

    <p>
      Great! You made it! This is one example of
      <em>uniform circular motion</em>. Uniform circular motion is when a body
      moves in a circle with a constant magnitude of velocity. Do note that even
      though the <em>magnitude</em> of velocity remains constant, the
      <em>direction</em> of velocity is always changing, so it has to be
      accelerating.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this acceleration never changes the direction of the velocity, it
      has to point perpendicular to the velocity.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this case, the acceleration is provided by the force the red body
      exerts on the blue one and is <em>radial</em> (points towards the centre
      of the circle), so for there to be uniform circular motion,
      <strong>the velocity must be tangential to the circle of motion</strong>,
      aka the angle is either 0 or 180 degrees pointing vertically up or down
      (in this situation with the blue planet starting directly to the right of
      the red one). You should have reached this same conclusion from the
      eariler demo.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ok, we know the <em>direction</em> of the velocity, but what about the
      <em>magnitude</em> of the velocity? Here is where the math comes in.
      Uniform circular motion is described by the equation $$a = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
      From a previous demo, we know that the force of gravitational attraction
      is $$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$ if we let $m_1$ be the mass of the blue
      planet and $m_2$ be the mass of the red planet. Applying Newton's second
      law, $$\begin{align*}F &= m_1 a \\ \Longrightarrow v &= \sqrt{\frac{G
      m_2}{r}}\end{align*}$$ Substituting in the masses of the red planet and
      the distances, we get a value of around $3.0 \times 10^4 \
      \text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$.
    </p>

    <aside class="info">
      You may have realised that the red planet is not moving at all, even
      though there is a net force acting on it. Is it violating Newton's second
      law?

      <p>
        No, although it doesn't <em>look like</em> its moving, it still is, just
        that because its so massive, we can safely assume that it stays fixed in
        place. This was explained in the last few paragraphs of the previous
        section.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      Actually, circular orbits are not the only types of trajectory that can
      exist in a two body system. If you played around with the previous demo,
      you might've realised that apart from circular trajectories, there are
      many other possible trajectories, for example what looks like an ellipse.
      And indeed, it can be proved that
      <strong
        >the trajectories of a body in a two body system is a conic
        section</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, what exactly is a conic section? It is simply a curve that can be
      obtained by the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane, as
      visualised by the figure below.

      In the figure, #1 is a circle, as we've already seen from the previous
      demo. #2 is an <em>ellipse</em>, #3 is a <em>parabola</em>, and #4 is a
      <em>hyperbola</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next few demos explores the different properties of an elliptical
      orbit. First, let's us look at two terms: the
      <strong>apoapsis point </strong>and the <strong>periapsis point</strong>.
      They are points on the blue planet's elliptical orbit. Try to deduce where
      these two points are in the next two demos.
    </p>

    <div id="apoapsis" class="canvas-container"></div>

    <p>
      As you might have deduced, the apoapsis point is the point on the orbit
      where the blue planet is the farthest away from the red one. Can you take
      an educated guess as to where the periapsis point is now?
    </p>

    <div id="periapsis" class="canvas-container"></div>

    <p>
      That's right, the periapsis point is just the point in the orbit where the
      two bodies are the closest.
